<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>FPRLogoTool allows you to import and export logos from Fire Pro Wrestling
Returns save data.</p>

<hr class="midline" />

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>.NET Framework v2.0 (so it should hopefully work in Wine)</li>
</ul>

<hr class="midline" />

<h3>Supported File Formats</h3>
<p>There are a myriad of PS2 save formats out there, and FPRLogoTool only
supports a few of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EMS Memory Linker</strong> (.psu) &ndash; A single game save, 952,320 bytes in length.</li>
<li>
	<strong>Raw save data</strong> &ndash; Raw save data (913,892 bytes length)
	ripped from the memory card. Typically has one of three names depending on
	the game/save region:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>BISLPM-66082</strong> &ndash; NTSC-J/Japanese</li>
	<li><strong>BASLUS-21702</strong> &ndash; NTSC-U/North American</li>
	<li><strong>BESLES-55041</strong> &ndash; PAL/Europe</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The program is pretty straightforward; the hardest part will be getting the
Fire Pro Returns save data, which is beyond the scope of this guide.</p>

<img src="program_init.png" title="Program on initial load." alt="A picture of the program after being launched. The form contains a large box where the logo images get loaded." />
<p>The default view upon starting the program. The large box in the middle of
the form will contain the logos once a save file is opened (via File &rarr; Open).</p>

<img src="program_view.png" title="Program after loading a save file." alt="A picture of the program after a save file is loaded. In this example, two logos appear in the first two slots." />
<p>Once a save is loaded, click on a logo to select it. This will enable the
Import and Export options found in the program.</p>

<h3>Import Raw Logo</h3>
<p>This option imports logo data from the Fire Pro Wrestling Returns raw logo format.</p>

<h3>Import from GIF</h3>
<p>This option imports a logo from a GIF file. Restrictions with regards to GIF
importing are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>No animated GIFs.</li>
<li>Images must be 128x128 pixels.</li>
<li>Image must use 64 colors or less.</li>
<li>Partial transparency (supported by raw logo format) is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Export Raw Logo</h3>
<p>This option exports the logo data in the raw format expected by Fire Pro Wrestling
Returns.</p>

<h3>Export to PNG</h3>
<p>This option exports the logo as a PNG file, retaining any alpha transparency.</p>
